HELLO WORLD!
	I wrote this using Vim 

	After i `vim hello_world.txt` and pressed `i` i edited this file.But i also found out that pressing `a` is a better idea. 
	Afterwards i pressed `:` to use the vim options and used the option `wq` so it saves
this is a test if i REALLY have to type "add <insert file name here>"
haha, this is another test 
	okay so this change has been made so i can check out if `git add .` works and if VSCode opens when i commit these changes
	I edit this line on the TestBranch1
	This is a change made in the TestBranch1
